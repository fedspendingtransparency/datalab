        <p>The possible projects using the USAspending.gov data could range from written analysis and recommendations to
          creating visualizations and a web-based tool to allow others to explore the data in a new way. Perhaps the final
          product answers a specific question or allows others with subject matter expertise to discover insights into the data.</p>,
        <p>While the final deliverable can range quite a bit, we expect three main components. First, the final product itself.
          Second, all code used to produce the final product. Third, a presentation on the process or journey the student/team
          took to arrive at their final conclusion or creation. We expect all three components to be made publicly available and
          potentially published to our main Data Lab website. Ideally, the student, school, or library will also be able to
          host the final products so that they do not disappear when the student moves on. We could also link to these permanent
          locations on the Data Lab website. Finally, the school is welcome to publish and promote the final products as a
          way to tout the value of real-world partnerships.</p>,
        <p>In summary, the three components of final products are:</p>,
        <ul>
          <li>
            Product/application/analysis (hosted on a school server and/or published to our site)
          </li>
          <li>
            Code
          </li>
          <li>
            Presentation on process
          </li>
        </ul>
      ]
    }
  ]
};
