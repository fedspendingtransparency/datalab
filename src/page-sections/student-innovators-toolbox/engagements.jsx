    and growing so let us know if you have suggestions for other types of engagement that better fits your needs.</p>,

        <>Use the data to learn about something else</>
      ],
      accordionContent: [
        <p>Quantitative courses at every level require datasets for classroom lessons, homework, problem sets, exams, and more. Courses we believe
          are a good fit for our data include those that focus on probability, statistics, econometrics, economics, federal budgeting, and data science.</p>,
        <p>There are two high-level options of USAspending.gov datasets: (1) a prepared, clean dataset and (2) a real-world, raw dataset. Below we explain
          what we mean by clean and raw, as well as the circumstances that call for each. Both options involve students using Python, R, Stata, SAS,
          Excel, or some other software to analyze (or clean then analyze) the data.</p>,
        <h1>
          Clean dataset
        </h1>,
        <p>A prepared and clean dataset is easier to use out of the gate because it is smaller and requires no data cleaning or data wrangling on the
          student’s part. That is, the data is in the desired format/shape to begin the desired analysis immediately. There are no missing or duplicate
          values, and the dataset contains a limited number of fields/columns. Prepared and clean datasets are best for teaching other concepts
          (e.g. regression analysis) when and you don’t want to overwhelm the student with the pre-cleaning steps. They’re also helpful for analysis
          and data visualization projects.</p>,
        <h1>
          Raw dataset
        </h1>,
        <p>
          In more advanced classes, the goal is to help the student understand how data will actually look when they first get it. This may require
          teaching the student how to handle missing values or de-duplicate records. Often original owners of data have it structured in a way to serve
          their own business purposes, so the student may be required to change the shape of the data entirely in a processing stage before they can
          begin any analysis. These types of data sets are useful for students learning data wrangling, data cleaning techniques; those learning more
          “real-world” data handling skills in order to prep datasets before they apply statistical techniques, or prior to learning different
          languages typical to data science, e.g. R or Python.</p>

      accordionTitles: [<>Use the data to learn about federal budgeting and/or federal spending</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>While the engagement above focuses on learning skills related to data and analysis, the courses mentioned are often
        agnostic to the actual content of the dataset. A second option is to use USAspending data to specifically focus its content for courses
        touching on federal budgeting or federal spending processes. Programs interested in federal government data may include both undergraduate
        and graduate levels for finance, accounting, public administration, public policy, or business schools.</p>,
        <p>Similar to above, this engagement includes two options: a prepared, clean dataset or “real-world” raw dataset that requires cleaning
          and preparation prior to consumption.</p>,
      <h1>Option 1) Clean dataset</h1>,

      accordionTitles: [<>Use the data for a consulting or capstone project (given a problem statement or question)</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>In this engagement, a student or student team uses data from USAspending.gov to identify a real-world question to
        answer. Using the principles of user-centered design as outlined in the Resources section, the student team identifies a “client”,
        and the student or team acts as analysts or consultants. The student team conducts initial interviews with the client to determine
        how USAspending.gov data can help answer a question or solve a problem, and the student team then researches, performs analysis,
        and provides recommendations in order to answer the question or advise a particular course of action. While this type of structure
        is common for public policy students, it can easily be applied to a wide variety of settings ranging from business to data science
        students, or even an interdisciplinary team where a “real-world” project is the goal (e.g. student associations, clubs).</p>,
        <p>The student team can decide, in consultation with their “client”, to produce a product or visualization instead of an analysis or
          recommendation. The focus would be less about gathering data to answer a specific question and providing a recommendation, and more
          about creating a product, tool, visualization for the Data Lab’s website and portfolio. Students with a wide range of backgrounds
          including, quantitative analysis, graphic design, UX, UI, design, data visualization, data science, computer science, and more can
          contribute to this type of engagement. Examples of software/languages used for executing tasks or analysis in this engagement are:
          Tableau, R and R Shiny, Python, Stata, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, D3, and React.</p>]
