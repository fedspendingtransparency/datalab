			The roles, responsibilities, and academic and time expectations vary for each
			type of engagement. We sketch these out below, but they are not set in stone.
			They are completely open to discussion to ensure both the institution’s and
			the Data Lab team's needs are being fulfilled.

					The Data Lab team works with a professor to develop a useful dataset (clean
					or raw dataset) for a specific course. We will work with the professor to
					answer any questions and ensure that he/she is comfortable with the content
					and data structure in order to incorporate the dataset into the course.
					These interactions can be via email, phone, screen shares, or video
					conferences—whatever works best.
				</p>,
				<h1>Academic & Time Expectations</h1>,
				<p>
					We provide professors datasets and assistance through Engagements 1 and 2
					as an upfront, pre-semester activity to allow enough time for professors to
					ask questions, understand the data, and incorporate the dataset into their
					curriculum. The Data Lab team is happy to field questions as they arise
					but, for the most part, the time or interactions required are mainly prior
					to a semester in order to get the right dataset for the course prepped,
					explained, and incorporated into the syllabus. We consider this a low level
					of commitment for both the professors and our team.

				<h1>Roles & Responsibilities</h1>,
				<p>
					The roles/responsibilities and time expectations are similar to above, with
					the expectation of slightly less “hand-holding” in this engagement. This
					engagement may be useful for long-term, and student-driven projects, such
					as an undergraduate thesis, master’s capstone project, or even a PhD
					thesis.
				</p>,
				<p>
					We are happy to meet with the students to get them started, but we will not
					offer a problem statement or task to execute. The students will explore the
					data themselves in order to decide on a problem they want to explore and
					answer, or a visualization/tool they want to build. The onus is on the
					student for the thought leadership and the drive to push the project along.
					In this engagement, there may likely be an undergraduate or graduate
					advisor assisting the student. We will work with the professor, advisor,
					etc. to establish what role our team will play in any evaluation (e.g.
					providing grades, answering surveys, etc.). However, all this is up for
					negotiation depending on your institution’s needs!
				</p>,
				<h1>Academic & Time Expectations</h1>,
				<p>
					These types of real world projects typically span a full semester and the
					students will likely be in a course or club that provides expectations and
					support during this time period. Students may have academic requirements
					for the course that are not necessarily required by the Data Lab team (e.g.
					course readings, literature reviews, etc.). Students are expected to put in
					the regular number of hours required for one semester-long course,
					including classes, meetings and work time and to provide a final product.
					We will be available for questions and regular communication and expect
					progress reports on a regular basis (e.g., once every two weeks). Lastly,
					the team will attend a presentation or demonstration of the final product.
