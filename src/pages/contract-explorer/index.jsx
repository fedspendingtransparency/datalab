			introSentence="The federal government spends about $500 billion each year on contracts - that's roughly the size of Sweden's economy."
			contextStatement="Ever wonder who's getting federal contracts and what agencies are awarding them? This tool lets you explore contract-related information for FY 18, including which organizations received federal contracts, contract amounts, awarding agencies and sub-agencies, and the types of goods or services contract recipients provided to the federal government."
			sectionTitle='How does the government buy things?'
			sectionText='<p>The federal government uses contracts to buy the things it needs, from office furniture to airplanes. It also uses contracts to buy services ranging from internet to research and development. Federal agencies and their sub-agencies are responsible for issuing contracts and categorizing the goods and services they purchase using Product and Service Codes (PSC).</p>
			<p>Although contracts and grants share some similarities, each serves a different purpose. Generally, contracts allow the government to purchase goods and services it will use to execute its mission, while grants allow the government to provide goods and services directly to the public. For example, the Air Force uses contracts to acquire fighter jets to execute its mission, while the Federal Highway Administration uses grants to provide funds to states for public roads.</p>'

					This diagram has three rings. The inner ring represents federal agencies, like the Department of Defense, which are sized by the total dollar amounts they spent on contracts in FY 17. The middle ring represents sub-agencies, like the Air Force, which in most cases actually award contracts to contractors. The outer ring represents the contractors who receive awards from those sub-agencies.
