            <p>Federal agencies are responsible for spending these funds to carry out their programs and operations, which the Treasury Department assists with by managing the federal government's accounts. All federal agencies have their own financial accounting systems to track money flowing in and out of accounts, and the Treasury Department is responsible for maintaining current and accurate information about the balances of agency accounts. This applies to accounts designated for paying individuals receiving Social Security, providing Medicare reimbursements, or paying for grants for roads and bridges.</p>"
